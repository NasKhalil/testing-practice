# Testing practice

In this project we will write a few practical tests for JavaScript functions using the Jest library.


1. Task 1

- Write a function stringLength(string) that takes any string as an argument and returns its characters count.
- Now write a test for this function.
- Next, expand your function to make it check if the string is at least 1 character long and not longer than 10 characters. Throw errors if those conditions are not met.
- Add tests for the new functionality.

2. Task 2

- Write a function reverseString(string) function. It should take a string as an argument and return it reversed.
- Write at least one test for this function.

3. Task 3

- Write a simple calculator class or object, which will have 4 methods: add, subtract, divide, and multiply.
- Write at least 3 tests for each of the calculator methods.
- Group tests for each method using describe() method.

4. Task 4

In this task we're going to do things differently:

- Start by writing a test for a capitalize(string) function. Your test should make sure that this function takes a string as an argument and returns that string with the first character capitalized.
- Run your test - it should fail because you don‚Äôt have the capitalize(string) function implemented yet.
- Now make your tests green by implementing the capitalize(string) function. Think about what the minimum amount of code is necessary to pass this test and write it.
